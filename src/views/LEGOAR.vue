    <h2>LEGO AR Assistant Concept Design</h2>
    <div>
        Study goal: The design opportunity that I wish to exploit by using augmented reality is to create a system that assists in the construction of LEGO block sets.

        Target Audience: My target audience includes smart device users of all ages that enjoy building with LEGOs, but with a specific focus on those below the age of 18 years old.  I have chosen this group as my target audience due to the fact that the app will need to be designed to keep in mind that the users in that age range may have a more difficult time discerning how to make use of the app.  This can be attributed to them not having as many experiences with technology to give them insight on how to solve issues they may be presented with through use of the app.
