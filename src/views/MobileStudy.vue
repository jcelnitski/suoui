    <h2>Mobile Shopping Study</h2>
    <div>
      In a recent study, I decided to explore a design opportunity to minimize the number of annoyances to mobile shoppers during their mobile shopping experience to entice more users to shop online.
      The target audience that I wish to reach is mobile phone users who use their mobile phones to buy things online.  I have chosen this group as my target audience because these mobile customers make up a large portion of
      online shoppers and we want to ensure the best mobile shopping ad experience that we can while being as minimally invasive as possible.

      To research this design opportunity, I interviewed mobile shoppers after having them complete a screening survey to determine their eligibility based off of their actual ability to shop online and whether or not they do
      shop online.

      I interviewed two participants and found that targeted ads encourage online shopping since all participants mentioned that they liked how ads shown content that is relative to the user and how these targeted ads help
      them to shop.  I also found that more invasive ads that pop up or make noise will cause users to immediately terminate their current shopping experience, as it did with my participant Trudy, pseudonym.
